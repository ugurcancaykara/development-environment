## Materials to study and generally getting a know-how about the topics
- vimtutor -> [X]
- kickstart docs -> []
- nvimtutor -> []
- nvim user help docs -> []

## Topics to quickly learn
- bufferline buffers vs Tabs vs Windows in Neovim -> []
- Null-LS Formatting(Kickstart already have an autoformat plugin, check it) -> [] 

## Plugins to install

- bufferline -> [X] -> gives buffers tab view appearance
- dressing -> [X] -> outlines a beautiful box to rename files etc.
- gitsigns -> [] -> git symbols at files, folders
- autopairs automatically close () {} '' "" -> [ ] -> automatically completes ending symbol of ({['"
- comment -> [] -> ?
- todo comments -> [] -> i think it's important to keep notes 
- auto-sessions (when you opened nvim, and <space>-w-r boom you are exactly at where you left) -> [] 
- greeter, alpha-nvim -> [] -> you can adjust appearance of enterance to nvim
- split maximizer -> [X] -> let's say you are using 2 window or 3 window and just want to work on selected, maximize it
- indent_blankline -> [X] -> it makes me gain some visuality while matching indents between code blocks etc.


## Scripts or shortcuts to adjust

- lazygit integration via neovim -> [X] -> cli integration into nvim so flow doesn't get interrupted
- :vsplit -> [X] -> assign a shortcut so a can quickly split screen
