## Materials to study and generally getting a know-how about the topics
- vimtutor -> [X]
- kickstart docs -> []
- nvimtutor -> []
- nvim user help docs -> []

## Topics to quickly learn
- bufferline buffers vs Tabs vs Windows in Neovim -> []
- Null-LS Formatting(Kickstart already have an autoformat plugin, check it) -> [] 

## Plugins to install

Installed ones:
- bufferline -> [X] -> gives buffers tab view appearance
- dressing -> [X] -> outlines a beautiful box to rename files etc.
- gitsigns -> [X] -> git symbols at files, folders
- autopairs automatically close () {} '' "" -> [X] -> automatically completes ending symbol of ({['"
- comment -> [X] -> It works to toggle comment the code blocks as multilines
- todo comments -> [X] -> i think it's important to keep notes 
- auto-sessions (when you opened nvim, and <space>-w-r boom you are exactly at where you left) -> [X] 
- greeter, alpha-nvim -> [] -> you can adjust appearance of enterance to nvim
- split maximizer -> [X] -> let's say you are using 2 window or 3 window and just want to work on selected, maximize it
- indent_blankline -> [X] -> it makes me gain some visuality while matching indents between code blocks etc.
- substitution -> [X] -> it simply helps you to replace yanked word, phrase or whatever it is with a word, sentence etc. Check the keymaps
- trouble -> [X] -> to gain holistic view on diagnostics, todos, instead of just wildly searching with telescope
- neo-tab -> [X] -> to tabout quotes, brackets easily with using tab


Not installed ones:
- surround -> [ ] -> it helps you to surround a word or a motion range with e.g `""` or `()` so it's all up to you, give it a try
- toggleterm -> [ ] -> it helps you to customize your terminal view for different plugins 
- [tabout.nvim](https://github.com/abecodes/tabout.nvim) -> [ ] -> since I'm using neo-tab for now, I won't try this unless neo-tab doesn't seem to work for my cases. Here is [custom](https://github.com/kr40/nvim/blob/master/lua/plugins/user-tabout.lua) configuration though


## Scripts or shortcuts to adjust

- lazygit integration via neovim -> [X] -> cli integration into nvim so flow doesn't get interrupted
- :vsplit -> [ ] -> assign a shortcut so a can quickly split screen
