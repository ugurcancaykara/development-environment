# Development Environment Setup

Welcome to my personal development environment setup repository! Here, you'll find everything you need to replicate my local development environment, including configurations, CLI tools, and other essential utilities I use daily. 

- Quick note: I will share a guide list like how to start learning and where from exactly. 

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive collection of all the tools and configurations I use to create a productive development environment. 

### Current Tools

Here are the primary tools I'm currently using:

- **iTerm2**: My terminal of choice for its extensive customization options and ease of use.
- **Neovim (nvim)**: My go-to text editor, configured for efficiency and enhanced with plugins.

## Installation

I've prepared a Makefile that automates the process, guiding you through an interactive installation. Just grab a cup of coffee, sit back, and let the script do the work. ðŸŽ‰

### How to Use

#### 1. Loading Neovim Configurations

To load your existing Neovim configurations into this repository, run the following command:

```bash
make load
```
then just continue to watch terminal and type when interactive mode needs an answer
